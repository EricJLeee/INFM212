    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>My name is Eric Lee and I'm currently pursuing a degree in Software Application and Human Computer Interaction. I recently moved to Georgia in the summer of 2020. I lived in Illinois nearly my whole life and I'm a die-hard Chicago Bears fan! In my free time, I enjoy strength training and eating different foods.

    <h2>Three Websites I Like</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><a href = "https://www.apple.com/" target = "_blank">Apple</a> - I think Apple's website does a great job of being minimal, modern, and professional all at the same time. It aligns with their products perfectly.</li>
        <li><a href = "https://www.roguefitness.com/" target = "_blank">Rogue Fitness</a> - I think Rogue did a good job on their organization. Fitness is a very broad industry and they were able to create proper labels to help navigate their site with red accents on a dominate black and white website to help guide newer customers.</li>
        <li><a href = "https://slickdeals.net/" target = "_blank">Slickdeals</a> - I think this is one of the better forum websites I use consistently. The frontpage view can be adjusted to the user's preference such as grid, list, or simple. Everything is categorized in a neat way including the different types of forum boards.</li>
      </ul>
    <h2>Three Websites I Do Not Like</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><a href = "https://www.reddit.com/" target = "_blank">Reddit</a> - I love using Reddit, but their website is just awful. The layout is inconsistent with their desktop, mobile, and app. The organization is not friendly nor customizable without using a chrome extension. Visually, it's not an attractive website.</li>
        <li><a href = "https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/" target = "_blank">Wirecutter</a> - I think wirecutter's website is lazy. There's too many repetitve cateogry and articles. In their top menu bar, they list seven different tabs and then end it with "More categories..." which contains ten more categories. I think they could've gone a better route for website navigation.</li>
        <li><a href = "https://www.nfl.com/" target = "_blank">NFL</a> - NFL's website is actually one I like a lot from a visual standpoint. There's two things that make this website awful and keeps me from using it unless I need to for stats. They have a lot of videos that autoplay and it's not always obvious which one it is. This is distracting, as most of the time, the video that is playing is not what I came to look for. Secondly, it does not have a search feature. Unless what I'm looking for is on the front page, it's difficult to find things.
